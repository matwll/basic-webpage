        <h3>A little about me</h3>
        <p>Hello,<br>&emsp;I am a Production Planner, currently learning web development. This website will evolve as
            my skills do. A little about me. I enjoy working on my car when I have time. Currently it needs some repair
            work since someone ran into me on the way home from work. I do not have any children, but I always have a
            dog around. Since there are so many in shelters I adopt middle age/older dogs. Currently I have 2 pitbulls
            named Addie and Aiden who are 9 years old.
